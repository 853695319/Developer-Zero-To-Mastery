## News

* [D3 5.0](https://parg.co/U7f): D3 5.0 introduces only a few non-backwards-compatible changes. D3 now uses Promises instead of asynchronous callbacks to load data.

With the adoption of promises, D3 now uses the Fetch API instead of XMLHttpRequest, the d3-request module has been replaced by d3-fetch.

Driver.js can be used wherever you need some sort of overlay for the page; some common usecases could be: e.g. dimming the background when user is interacting with some component.
