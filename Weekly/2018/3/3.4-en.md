By the way, sorry for my poor English.

## News

* [D3 5.0](https://parg.co/U7f): D3 5.0 introduces only a few non-backwards-compatible changes. D3 now uses Promises instead of asynchronous callbacks to load data. Promises simplify the structure of asynchronous code, especially in modern browsers that support async and await. With the adoption of promises, D3 now uses the Fetch API instead of XMLHttpRequest, the d3-request module has been replaced by d3-fetch.

## Tutorial

* [How to build a Cryptocurrency price list app using Flutter SDK](https://parg.co/U2K): Flutter is Google’s new open-source toolkit for helping developers build iOS and Android apps with just one codebase. Flutter apps are written in the Dart programming language and compile to native code, so the performance is really, really great. In this tutorial, I will show you how to use Flutter to build an app that shows the current price of different cryptocurrencies. I will walk you through the fundamentals of Flutter and Dart.

## Engineering Practices

* [Comparing the top JS animation libraries for use in React apps](https://parg.co/Ux9): You may have noticed that animation is pretty popular on the web. There’s no shortage of tutorials, case studies, and libraries targeting motion lovers. It’s a facet of development that can intrigue, enhance, delight, motivate, and impress users. In this article, I’ve chosen five JavaScript animation libraries and dissected their abilities to perform from both a business and a development perspective. Instead of asking “what do I use to build X?”, I explore concerns like: How well is this project maintained? Is it easy for a team to pick up? What’s the syntax like?

## Under the hood

## OpenSource

* [Driver.js](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/driver.js): Driver.js is a powerful yet light-weight, vanilla JavaScript engine to drive the user's focus across the page. Driver.js is not only another tour library, Tours are just one of the many use-cases. Driver.js can be used wherever you need some sort of overlay for the page; some common usecases could be: e.g. dimming the background when user is interacting with some component.

* [brain.js](https://github.com/BrainJS/brain.js): brain.js is a library of Neural Networks written in JavaScript.

* [dejavu](https://github.com/appbaseio/dejavu): dejavu is the missing web UI for Elasticsearch. Existing web UIs leave much to be desired or are built with server side page rendering techniques that make it less responsive and bulkier to run (I am looking at you, Kibana).Starting v1.0, dejavu is the only Elasticsearch web UI that supports importing data via JSON and CSV files, as well as defining field mappings from the GUI.
